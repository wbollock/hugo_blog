A short post on studying for and passing AWS CCP.

Estimate: 1 Minute Read

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
--------------------------------

Recently passed the AWS CCP (91.7% ðŸ˜€) exam after one week of studying. There are many guides like this on the Internet, but nevertheless here are the resources I used.

### Background:

*   Bachelors in IT
*   Masters in IT (1 last semester)
*   HelpDesk/Sysadmin for ~3 years (on-prem)
*   No professional cloud experience, but lots of on-prem experience. Linux/IaaC

### Resources:

*   [Free - Reddit posts like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/b2m2vk/anyone_taken_the_aws_certified_cloud_practitioner/)
*   [Free - AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Video Course (6 hours)](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=17675)
*   [Free - AWS Overview White Paper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-overview.pdf)
*   [~$12 - Udemy Practice Exams (Shoot for 85%+)](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/)

And lastly, [my rough notes](../AWSCloudPractitioner.pdf). These notes cover all 6 hours of the AWS video course and Udemy practice exams.

I recommend taking notes on _all_ practice test terms you donâ€™t recall (Amazon Neptune, anyone?), understanding billing, understanding the Clouds\* (CloudFront, CloudWatch, CloudFormation), and get a little hands-on AWS Free Tier experience.

One small trick is that the Udemy practice tests may try to trick you with Amazon Connect. Itâ€™s just a call center, nothing to do with networking.

Other than that, itâ€™s not that difficult. Just brain dump for the exam and deal with PearsonVue, and youâ€™ll be fine.
